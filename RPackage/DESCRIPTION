Description: AquaFortR is an educational package for students and researchers in 
    Atmospheric Science, Oceanography, Climate, and Water Research. AquaFortR aims 
    to show that using simple Fortran scripts can fulfil the need to speed up R, 
    especially considering that most data sets in these fields are large discretised 
    arrays representing earth system processes. Fortran is one of the fastest 
    programming languages in number crunching, if not the fastest, and 
    multidimensional arrays are a core part of Fortran.
