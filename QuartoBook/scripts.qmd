# Accelerate R Scripts with Fortran {#sec-scripts}

In this chapter, we will compare the efficiency of running three
computationally demanding examples in pure R script versus using another
R script with the core computations performed in Fortran.

## 2D Coss-Correlation {#sec-2Dxcorr}

<!-- What is CC  -->

<!-- What is used for  -->

In signal processing, cross-correlation measures similarity
between two signals as a function of the displacement of one relative to
the other [@Wang2019]. It can deliver information about the time lag
between the two signals. 2D cross-correlation is often applied in computer
vision for visual tracking. For example, it is used in template
matching, feature detection, and motion tracking. 2D cross-correlation
also plays an important role in convolutional networks and machine
learning.

<!-- How it is important in Atmospheric Science, Oceanography, Climate, and Water Research -->

In atmospheric science, oceanography, climate, and water research, 2D
cross-correlation can be applied in various ways. For example, it can be
used to estimate ocean surface currents [@Warren2016], cloud tracking
using satellite imagery [@Seelig2021], and Particle Image Velocimetry
(PIV) in fluid dynamics applications [@Willert1991].

The 2D cross-correlation of an array $F_{(M, N)}$, and
array $G_{(P, Q)}$, can be given as the array $CC_{(M+P-1, N+Q-1)}$ as shown in @eq-2DCC.

$$
CC_{(s,t)} = \sum_{m = 0}^{M-1}\sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} F_{(m,n)} G_{(m-s, n-t)}
$$ {#eq-2DCC}

where $s$ varies between $-(P-1)$ and $(M-1)$ while $t$ varies between
$-(Q-1)$ and $(N-1)$. $F$ and $G \in R$.

Now, let us define the `xcorr2D_r` function as shown in @lst-xcorrr. The
function receives two matrices or arrays `a` & `b` and return the full
cross-correlation plane `cc`.

```{r}
#| lst-label: lst-xcorrr
#| lst-cap: Cross-correlation in R
xcorr2D_r0 <- function(a, b) {
  # the full CC matrix
  cc_row <- nrow(a) + nrow(b) - 1
  cc_col <- ncol(a) + ncol(b) - 1
  cc <- matrix(1:c(cc_row * cc_col),
    byrow = FALSE, ncol = cc_col
  )

  # obtain possible shifts
  min_row_shift <- -(nrow(b) - 1)
  max_row_shift <- (nrow(a) - 1)
  min_col_shift <- -(ncol(b) - 1)
  max_col_shift <- (ncol(a) - 1)

  # Padded matrix
  rows_padded <- abs(min_row_shift) +
    nrow(a) + abs(max_row_shift)
  cols_padded <- abs(min_col_shift) +
    ncol(a) + abs(max_col_shift)
  # a
  padded_a <- matrix(0,
    nrow = rows_padded,
    ncol = cols_padded
  )
  padded_a[
    (abs(min_row_shift) + 1):(abs(min_row_shift) + nrow(a)),
    (abs(min_col_shift) + 1):(abs(min_col_shift) + ncol(a))
  ] <- a

  for (icol in 1:cc_col) {
    for (irow in 1:cc_row) {
      icc <- irow + ((icol - 1) * cc_row)
      cols <- (icol):(icol + ncol(b) - 1)
      rows <- (irow):(irow + nrow(b) - 1)
      # b
      padded_b <- array(0,
        dim = c(rows_padded, cols_padded)
      )
      padded_b[rows, cols] <- b

      cc[irow, icol] <- sum(padded_a * padded_b)
    }
  }

  return(cc)
}
```



Moving forward, we can define the `xcorr2d_f` subroutine in Fortran as
shown in @lst-xcorrf. Subroutines are generally the approach for integrating 
Fortran in R. Function in Fortran return a single value with no option of 
altering the input arguments, while subroutines have the
ability to perform complex tasks while altering input arguments.
This proofs to be helpful e.g., in solving equations system.

Another imperative point is to define the dimension of the arrays when
passing them to Fortran (i.e. explicit-shape arrays). To illustrate, 
`m, n, p, q, k, l` are the dimension of input arrays `a`and `b`, and 
the out array `cc`.

```{fortran, eval=FALSE}
#| lst-label: lst-xcorrf
#| lst-cap: Cross-correlation in Fortran
subroutine xcorr2d_f(m, n, p, q, k, l, a, b, cc)
   implicit none
   integer                                :: m, n, p, q, k, l
   double precision, dimension(m, n)      :: a
   double precision, dimension(p, q)      :: b

   !     obtain possible shfits
   min_row_shift = -1*(p - 1)
   max_row_shift = m - 1
   min_col_shift = -1*(q - 1)
   max_col_shift = n - 1

   !   Padded arrray
   rows_padded = abs(min_row_shift) + m + abs(max_row_shift)
   cols_padded = abs(min_col_shift) + n + abs(max_col_shift)
   !    A
   allocate (padded_a(rows_padded, cols_padded))
   padded_a = 0.0
   padded_a((abs(min_row_shift) + 1):(abs(min_row_shift) + m), &
            (abs(min_col_shift) + 1):(abs(min_col_shift) + n)) = a

   !    B
   allocate (padded_b(rows_padded, cols_padded))
   padded_b = 0.0
   do icol = 1, l
      do irow = 1, k
         icc = irow + ((icol - 1)*k)
         icol2 = icol + q - 1
         irow2 = irow + p - 1
         padded_b(irow:irow2, icol:icol2) = b
         cc(irow, icol) = sum(padded_a*padded_b)
         padded_b = 0.0
      end do
   end do
end subroutine xcorr2d_f
```

Since Fortran is a compiled language, we need to save the subroutine in
`xcorr2D.f90` file and compile it using: `R CMD SHLIB xcorr2D.f90`.

::: callout-note
Please use the terminal tab in Rstudio or open a new terminal using
`Alt+Shift+R`
:::

As mentioned earlier, we need to pass the dimension of the arrays to
Fortran. Therefore, it would logical to write a wrapping function for
Fortran subroutine that provides other input arguments. 

In the wrapper function (@lst-xcorrfr), we initially require loading 
the shared object (`.so` or `.dll`), which is the compiled Fortran subroutine, as 
`dyn.load("path/to/xcorr2D.dll")`. Furthermore, it is important to prepare 
other input variables for Fortran such as the dimensions of the input and 
output arrays. Imperatively, data types should be approached carefully. Before 
calling `.Fortran()`, all storage mode of the variables in R was 
converted to the appropriate type using either `as.double()` or `as.integer()`. 
If the wrong type is passed, it can result in a hard-to-catch error or 
unexpected results^[Writing R Extensions, 5.2 Interface functions .C and .Fortran].



```{r}
#| lst-label: lst-xcorrfr
#| lst-cap: Cross-correlation wrapping function 
xcorr2D_f0 <- function(a, b) {
  # Please adjust the path to your setup.
  dyn.load("AquaFortR_Codes/xcorr2D.dll")

  # the full CC matrix
  cc_row <- nrow(a) + nrow(b) - 1
  cc_col <- ncol(a) + ncol(b) - 1
  cc <- matrix(1:c(cc_row * cc_col), byrow = FALSE, ncol = cc_col)

  cc<- .Fortran("xcorr2d_f",
    m = as.integer(dim(a)[1]),
    n = as.integer(dim(a)[2]),
    p = as.integer(dim(b)[1]),
    q = as.integer(dim(b)[2]),
    k = as.integer(cc_row),
    l = as.integer(cc_row),
    a = as.double(a),
    b = as.double(b),
    cc = as.double(cc)
  )$cc

  return(cc)
}
```

On Windows, `R CMD SHLIB` produces dynamic-link library (dll) files. Please 
adjust the library extension in R functions according to your OS.

Now, we can use an example to compare the performance of the two functions. 
In order to do so, `microbenchmark` package [@R-microbenchmark] and `ggplot2` [@ggplot22016; @R-ggplot2] 
are required.
 
The obtained benchmarking data allows (`mbm`) for a quantitative comparison of 
the computational efficiency between the two methods. By printing "mbm" in the console 
(`print(mbm)`) it is evident that Fortran outperforms the R implementation of 2D 
cross-correlation by a factor of ~10. The significance of leveraging Fortran becomes 
evident in @fig-xcorr2D.


```{r}
#| label: fig-xcorr2D
#| fig-cap: "Performance comparison of 2D Cross-correlation in R and Fortran. Median is shown as red vertical line."

set.seed(72)
# Assume a
a <- structure(runif(64), dim = c(8L, 8L))
# Assume b
b <- structure(runif(64), dim = c(8L, 8L))
mbm <- microbenchmark(
  xcorr2D_r0 = xcorr2D_r0(a, b),
  xcorr2D_f0 = xcorr2D_f0(a, b)
)

autoplot(mbm) +
  stat_summary(
    fun = "median",
    geom = "crossbar",
    width = 0.6,
    colour = "red"
  )
```

## 2D Convolution

Convolution and cross-correlation are both operations applied to two dimensional data (e.g., matrix). 
Cross-correlation involves sliding a kernel (filter) across a matrix, 
while convolution involves sliding a flipped kernel across an matrix [@Draelos_2019].
Most spatial data in earth science are is discretised resulting in large data
sets. Sometimes, these data sets include noise which can obscure meaningful 
patterns and relationships. One of the prominent methods to remove this nose while 
preserving important features and structures is the Gaussian smoothing filter. 
Gaussian smoothing is often achieved by convolution where $F$ is the original 
data, and $G$ is the kernel representing the 2D Gaussian coefficients.


The 2D convolution of an array $F_{(M, N)}$, 
and array $G_{(P, Q)}$, can be given as the array $Conv_{(M+P-1, N+Q-1)}$. 
$hv$ means that $G$ is flipped.

$$
Conv_{(s,t)} = \sum_{m = 0}^{M-1}\sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} F_{(m,n)} G_{(m-s, n-t)}^{hv}
$$ {#eq-conv}

where $s$ varies between $-(P-1)$ and $(M-1)$ while $t$ varies between
$-(Q-1)$ and $(N-1)$. $F$ and $G \in R$.

Indeed, it is possible to flip the second array and utilise the functions from 
@sec-2Dxcorr. Nevertheless, our focus is on the comprehensive workflow. 
@lst-convrr presents the implementation of convolution in R, whereas 
@lst-convrf demonstrates the Fortran version.

```{r}
#| lst-label: lst-convrr
#| lst-cap: Convolution in R

  # the full convolution matrix
  conv_row <- nrow(a) + nrow(b) - 1
  conv_col <- ncol(a) + ncol(b) - 1
  conv <- matrix(1:c(conv_row * conv_col), byrow = FALSE, ncol = conv_col)

  # obtain possible shifts
  min_row_shift <- -(nrow(b) - 1)
  max_row_shift <- (nrow(a) - 1)
  min_col_shift <- -(ncol(b) - 1)
  max_col_shift <- (ncol(a) - 1)

  # Padded matrix
  rows_padded <- abs(min_row_shift) + nrow(a) + abs(max_row_shift)
  cols_padded <- abs(min_col_shift) + ncol(a) + abs(max_col_shift)
  # a
  padded_a <- matrix(0, nrow = rows_padded, ncol = cols_padded)
  padded_a[
    (abs(min_row_shift) + 1):(abs(min_row_shift) + nrow(a)),
    (abs(min_col_shift) + 1):(abs(min_col_shift) + ncol(a))
  ] <- a

  for (icol in 1:conv_col) {
    for (irow in 1:conv_row) {
      iconv <- irow + ((icol - 1) * conv_row)
      cols <- (icol):(icol + ncol(b) - 1)
      rows <- (irow):(irow + nrow(b) - 1)
      # b
      padded_b <- array(0, dim = c(rows_padded, cols_padded))
      # flip the kernel i.e. b
      padded_b[rows, cols] <- b[nrow(b):1, ncol(b):1]

      conv[irow, icol] <- sum(padded_a * padded_b)
    }
  }

  return(conv)
}
```

::: {.callout-note}
A Gaussian smoothing filter can be applied to an array `a` using `b` as the Gaussian kernel 
or the 2D Gaussian coefficients. However, the convolution and cross-correlation 
can be optimised using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). See @sec-summary.

end subroutine conv2d_f
```


The gfortran compiler is also capable of creating shared libraries. 
It allows for easy addition of other flags, such as enabling the generation of 
the run-time check (`-fcheck=all`). The code below shows two options for 
compiling `conv2D.f90` by R or the gfortran compiler. 


```{bash}
#| eval: FALSE
# R
R CMD SHLIB conv2D.f90

# gfortran on Unix-like
gfortran -shared conv2D.f90 -o conv2D.so

# gfortran on Windows
gfortran -shared conv2D.f90 -o conv2D.dll
```

In R wrapper function, `.C64()` from dotCall64 package [@dotCall642018; @R-dotCall64] will be used instead of `.Fortran()`. According to @dotCall642018, `.C64()` transcends other foreign function interfaces in many aspects: 

  - It supports long vectors. 
  - The `SIGNATURE` argument ensures that the interfaced R objects 
      are of the specified types
  - The `INTENT` argument helps avoid unnecessary copies of R objects
      between languages. 
 

In @lst-convrfr, the basic input arguments, such as the dimensions of input and 
output arrays, are prepared. Afterwards, the `SIGNATURE` is defined as six 
integers and three doubles corresponding to the required types in the subroutine. 
`INTENT` will ensure that only the `conv` argument is copied between R and Fortran. 
This is particularly important when processing large data set, where coping the subroutine 
arguments extends beyond the available memory (RAM).


```{r}
#| lst-label: lst-convrfr

Similar to cross-correlation calculation, the Fortran implementation of convolution 
outperforms the R one by a factor of ~10. Performing convolution in large data set
using R and Fortran is beneficial since it reduce the required computational resources.

## Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE)

<!-- definition  -->
According to the [Glossary of Meteorology](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Convective_available_potential_energy), 
CAPE is "the potential energy of an air parcel due to positive buoyancy, which is a useful tool for forecasting, parameterising, and estimating the potential updraft strength of convective clouds."
CAPE is calculated as follows [@stull2016practical]:

$$
CAPE =  R_d \sum_{p_{LFC}}^{p_{EL}} (T_p - T_v) . ln(\frac{p_{bottom}}{p_{top}})
$$ {#eq-cape}

where $R_d$ is the gas constant for dry air, $T_p$ is the parcel temperature, $T_e$
is the environment temperature, $p$ is pressure, $LFC$ is the Level of Free Convection,
and $EL$ is the Equilibrium Level.  

In a warming climate, CAPE is expected to increase [@Chen2020], which can result 
in an elevated risk of thunderstorms. It is crucial for humanity to quantify the 
future risk for proper preparation and mitigation. Typically, thunderstorms are 
investigated with convective-permitting modelling (CPM) where the horizontal 
resolution is less than 4km. CPM simulations produce vast amount of data sets, 
and CAPE estimation at a specific gridpoint and time is an integration along the vertical profile (@eq-cape). 


Given the rapid advancements in computing power, it is anticipated that  CPM is 
expected to be performed at finer horizontal and vertical resolution, 
thereby increasing the complexity of the CAPE estimation. It is essential that the 
enhancement of computing power is accompanied by responsible management and 
resource allocation.

Because the CAPE calculation scripts are highly complex and lengthy, the necessary 
codes are only available in the supplementary materials. Additionally, to test the 
two implementations of CAPE, the AquaFortR package was installed to utilise the 
example data. See @lst-cape.

Foremost, the Fortran subroutine need to be complied as shown in previous 
sections. The path to the shared library cape_f.so in cape_f.R file should be 
adapted to the correct path. 
:::

As mentioned, integration between R and Fortran should be accomplished through 
subroutines. Nevertheless, some calculations are complex, and using functions 
or other subroutines is inevitable. In cape.f90, a module containing all the 
required utilities was written, and then the main subroutine was included. 
The approach ensures `cape_f` has access to the module and is simultaneously available to R. 

Exploring @fig-cape, it is evident that the implementation of Fortran is faster than R by a factor of ~28, proofing that integrating Fortran in R is vital for performance and beneficial for the environment.
